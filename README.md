tag-my-tracks (tmt)
---
tag-my-tracks is a command line tool to manage id3 tags of your music library.

## Why the name?
`tmt` is quick to type when you're already in a terminal. 
None of the songs or artists in my music library seemed to convey "cli tool for managing mp3 tags",
so I just took `tmt` and made up something that fit. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
